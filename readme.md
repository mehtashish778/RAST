# HAZOP Analysis Tool

A Streamlit-based application for conducting HAZOP (Hazard and Operability) studies and LOPA (Layer of Protection Analysis) for process safety engineering.

## Overview
The HAZOP (Hazard and Operability Study) Analysis Tool is a Streamlit-based web application designed to facilitate process safety analysis in chemical and process industries. This tool combines equipment assessment, scenario analysis, Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA), and consequence modeling in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Chemical Database Management
- Equipment Database Management 
- HAZOP Scenario Management and Analysis
- Consequence Modeling Functionality
- Risk Assessment Matrix
- Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) (Coming Soon)
- Report Generation (Coming Soon)

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mehtashish778/hazop-analysis-tool.git
   cd hazop-analysis-tool
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```
   streamlit run app/app.py
   ```

2. Navigate to `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser.

3. Use the sidebar navigation to switch between different tools:
   - Home: Overview of the application
   - Chemical Database: Manage chemical properties
   - Equipment Database: Manage process equipment
   - Scenarios: Create and analyze HAZOP scenarios

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite with pytest:

1. Install test dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r tests/requirements-test.txt
   ```

2. Run all tests with coverage reporting:
   ```
   python -m pytest --cov=app
   ```

3. View test results and coverage reports in the terminal or generate HTML reports:
   ```
   python -m pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
   ```

See the [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) file for more detailed testing instructions.

### Test Coverage

Current test coverage is at 13% of the codebase, with primary coverage in:
- Consequence calculation module (88% coverage)
- Data access layer (53% coverage)
- Database management (45% coverage)

Key tested components:
- Consequence risk scoring and categorization
- Database connection and query execution
- Data access objects for equipment and scenarios
- Basic application functionality

Ongoing test development is focused on increasing coverage for UI components and remaining core modules.

## Data Management

- The application uses SQLite for data storage by default
- Database files are stored in the `app/data` directory
- Data can be imported/exported from Excel or CSV files

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or newer
- Streamlit 1.22.0 or newer
- See requirements.txt for complete list of dependencies
